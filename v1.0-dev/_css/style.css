/* Code annotations with numbers.
 *
 * Normally annotations are shown with a (+) button that expands the
 * annotation. To be able to explain code step by step, it is good to have
 * annotations with numbers, to be able to follow the notes in a particular
 * order.
 *
 * To do this, we need some custom CSS rules. Before this customization was
 * officially supported and documented, but now they are not officially
 * supported anymore, so it could eventually break (it already did once).
 *
 * If that happens we either need to look into how to fix the CSS ourselves or
 * remove the feature. To do the customization, this is what we should be able
 * to count on:
 *
 * "you can be sure that the data-md-annotation-id attribute will always be
 * present in the source, which means you can always number them in any way you
 * like."
 *
 * Code annotation are described here:
 * https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/reference/code-blocks/#code-annotations
 *
 * Here are the original docs on how to enable numbered annotations:
 * https://web.archive.org/web/20230724161216/https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/reference/code-blocks/#annotations-with-numbers
 *
 * This is the PR fixing the numbered annotations when they broke:
 * https://github.com/frequenz-floss/frequenz-sdk-python/pull/684
 *
 * And this is the reported regression when it was decided to drop support for
 * numbered annotations officially:
 * https://github.com/squidfunk/mkdocs-material/issues/6042
