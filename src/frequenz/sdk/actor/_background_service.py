class BackgroundService(abc.ABC):
    """A background service that can be started and stopped.

    A background service is a service that runs in the background spawning one or more
    tasks. The service can be [started][frequenz.sdk.actor.BackgroundService.start]
    and [stopped][frequenz.sdk.actor.BackgroundService.stop] and can work as an
    async context manager to provide deterministic cleanup.

    To implement a background service, subclasses must implement the
    [`start()`][frequenz.sdk.actor.BackgroundService.start] method, which should
    start the background tasks needed by the service, and add them to the `_tasks`
    protected attribute.

    If you need to collect results or handle exceptions of the tasks when stopping the
    service, then you need to also override the
    [`stop()`][frequenz.sdk.actor.BackgroundService.stop] method, as the base
    implementation does not collect any results and re-raises all exceptions.

    !!! warning

        As background services manage [`asyncio.Task`][] objects, a reference to them
        must be held for as long as the background service is expected to be running,
        otherwise its tasks will be cancelled and the service will stop. For more
        information, please refer to the [Python `asyncio`
        documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio-task.html#asyncio.create_task).

    Example:
        ```python
        import datetime
        import asyncio

        class Clock(BackgroundService):
            def __init__(self, resolution_s: float, *, name: str | None = None) -> None:
                super().__init__(name=name)
                self._resolution_s = resolution_s

            def start(self) -> None:
                self._tasks.add(asyncio.create_task(self._tick()))

            # Manual start/stop (only use if necessary, as cleanup is more complicated)

            clock.start()
