"""This module provides feature to set active_power between many batteries.

Distributing active_power is very important to keep the microgrid ready
for the active_power requirements.
This module provides PowerDistributingActor that knows how to distribute active_power.
It also provides all the secondary features that should be used to communicate with
PowerDistributingActor and send requests for charging or discharging active_power.
