"""Actor to distribute power between batteries.

When charge/discharge method is called the power should be distributed so that
the SoC in batteries stays at the same level. That way of distribution
prevents using only one battery, increasing temperature, and maximize the total
amount power to charge/discharge.

Purpose of this actor is to keep SoC level of each component at the equal level.

    """Tool to distribute power between batteries in microgrid.

    The purpose of this tool is to keep equal SoC level in the batteries.
    PowerDistributor can have many users. Each user should first register in order
    to get its id, channel for sending request, and channel for receiving response.

    It is recommended to wait for PowerDistributor output with timeout. Otherwise if
    the processing function fail then the response will never come.
    The timeout should be Result:request_timeout_sec + time for processing the request.

    Edge cases:
    * If there are 2 requests to be processed for the same subset of batteries, then
    only the latest request will be processed. Older request will be ignored. User with
    older request will get response with Result.Status.IGNORED.

    * If there are 2 requests and their subset of batteries is different but they
    overlap (they have at least one common battery), then then both batteries
    will be processed. However it is not expected so the proper error log will be
    printed.
