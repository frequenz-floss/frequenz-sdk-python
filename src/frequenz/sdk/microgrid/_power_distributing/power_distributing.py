distributing the power between the components and sends the results back to it.

    One instance of the actor can handle only one component category and type,
    which needs to be specified at actor startup and it will setup the correct
    component manager based on the given category and type.

    Only one power request is processed at a time to prevent from sending
    multiple requests for the same components to the microgrid API at the
    same time.

    Edge cases:
    * If a new power request is received while a power request with the same
    set of components is being processed, the new request will be added to
    the pending requests. Then the pending request will be processed after the
    request with the same set of components being processed is done. Only one
    pending request is kept for each set of components, the latest request will
    overwrite the previous one if there is any.

    * If there are 2 requests and their set of components is different but they
    overlap (they have at least one common component), then both requests will
    be processed concurrently. Though, the power manager will make sure this
    doesn't happen as overlapping component IDs are not possible at the moment.
