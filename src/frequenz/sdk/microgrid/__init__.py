"""A {{glossary("microgrid")}} is a local electrical grid that connects a set of
electrical components together.  They are often built around a passive power consumer,
to supplement the electricity consumed from the {{glossary("grid", "public grid")}} with
on-site power generation or storage systems.

Microgrids can also function in {{glossary("island", "island-mode")}}, without a grid
connection, or without a local power consumer, but they have to have at least one of the
two, to be meaningful.

## Frequenz SDK Microgrid Model

The SDK aims to provide an abstract model of the microgrid that enables high-level
interactions with {{glossary("component", "microgrid components")}}, without having to
worry about (or even be aware of) location-specific details such as:

- where the {{glossary("meter", "meters")}} are placed,
- how many {{glossary("battery", "batteries")}},
- whether there's a grid connection or a passive consumer,
- what models the {{glossary("inverter", "inverters")}} are, etc.
- whether components are having downtimes, because {{glossary("metric", "metrics")}} and
  limits get adjusted automatically when components are having downtimes.

Users of the SDK can develop applications around this interface once and deploy
anywhere, and the SDK will take care of translating the requests and instructions to
correspond to the specific microgrid configurations.

## Grid

This refers to a microgrid's connection to the external Grid.  The power flowing through
this connection can be streamed through
[`grid_power`][frequenz.sdk.timeseries.grid.Grid.power].

In locations without a grid connection, this method remains accessible, and streams zero
values.

## Consumer

This is the main power consumer at the site of a microgrid, and often the
{{glossary("load")}} the microgrid is built to support.  The power drawn by the consumer
is available through [`consumer_power`][frequenz.sdk.timeseries.consumer.Consumer.power]

In locations without a consumer, this method streams zero values.

## Producers: PV Arrays, CHP

The total CHP production in a site can be streamed through
[`chp_power`][frequenz.sdk.timeseries.logical_meter.LogicalMeter.chp_power].  PV Power
is available through the PV pool described below.  And total producer power is available
through [`microgrid.producer().power`][frequenz.sdk.timeseries.producer.Producer.power].

As is the case with the other methods, if PV Arrays or CHPs are not available in a
microgrid, the corresponding methods stream zero values.

## PV Arrays

The total PV power production is available through
[`pv_pool`][frequenz.sdk.microgrid.new_pv_pool]'s
[`power`][frequenz.sdk.timeseries.pv_pool.PVPool.power].  The PV pool by default uses
all PV inverters available at a location, but PV pool instances can be created for
subsets of PV inverters if necessary, by specifying the inverter ids.

The `pv_pool` also provides available power bounds through the
[`power_status`][frequenz.sdk.timeseries.pv_pool.PVPool.power_status] method.

The `pv_pool` also provides a control method
[`propose_power`][frequenz.sdk.timeseries.pv_pool.PVPool.propose_power], which accepts
values in the {{glossary("psc", "Passive Sign Convention")}} and supports only
production.


## Batteries

The total Battery power is available through the
[`battery_pool`][frequenz.sdk.microgrid.new_battery_pool]'s
[`power`][frequenz.sdk.timeseries.battery_pool.BatteryPool.power].  The battery pool by
default uses all batteries available at a location, but battery pool instances can be
created for subsets of batteries if necessary, by specifying the battery ids.

The `battery_pool` also provides
[`soc`][frequenz.sdk.timeseries.battery_pool.BatteryPool.soc],
[`capacity`][frequenz.sdk.timeseries.battery_pool.BatteryPool.capacity],
[`temperature`][frequenz.sdk.timeseries.battery_pool.BatteryPool.temperature] and
available power bounds through the
[`power_status`][frequenz.sdk.timeseries.battery_pool.BatteryPool.power_status] method.

The `battery_pool` also provides control methods
[`propose_power`][frequenz.sdk.timeseries.battery_pool.BatteryPool.propose_power] (which
accepts values in the {{glossary("psc", "Passive Sign Convention")}} and supports both
charging and discharging), or through
[`propose_charge`][frequenz.sdk.timeseries.battery_pool.BatteryPool.propose_charge], or
[`propose_discharge`][frequenz.sdk.timeseries.battery_pool.BatteryPool.propose_discharge].

## EV Chargers

The [`ev_charger_pool`][frequenz.sdk.microgrid.new_ev_charger_pool] offers a
[`power`][frequenz.sdk.timeseries.ev_charger_pool.EVChargerPool.power] method that
streams the total power measured for all the {{glossary("ev-charger", "EV Chargers")}}
at a site.

The `ev_charger_pool` also provides available power bounds through the
[`power_status`][frequenz.sdk.timeseries.ev_charger_pool.EVChargerPool.power_status]
method.


The `ev_charger_pool` also provides a control method
[`propose_power`][frequenz.sdk.timeseries.ev_charger_pool.EVChargerPool.propose_power],
which accepts values in the {{glossary("psc", "Passive Sign Convention")}} and supports
only charging.

# Component pools

The SDK provides a unified interface for interacting with sets of Batteries, EV
chargers and PV arrays, through their corresponding `Pool`s.

* [Battery pool][frequenz.sdk.microgrid.new_battery_pool]
* [EV charger pool][frequenz.sdk.microgrid.new_ev_charger_pool]
* [PV pool][frequenz.sdk.microgrid.new_pv_pool]

All of them provide support for streaming aggregated data and for setting the
power values of the components.

## Streaming component data

All pools have a `power` property, which is a
[`FormulaEngine`][frequenz.sdk.timeseries.formula_engine.FormulaEngine] that can

- provide a stream of resampled power values, which correspond to the sum of the
power measured from all the components in the pool together.

- be composed with other power streams to for composite formulas.

In addition, the battery pool has some additional properties that can be used as
streams for metrics specific to batteries:
[`soc`][frequenz.sdk.timeseries.battery_pool.BatteryPool.soc],
[`capacity`][frequenz.sdk.timeseries.battery_pool.BatteryPool.capacity] and
[`temperature`][frequenz.sdk.timeseries.battery_pool.BatteryPool.temperature].

## Setting power

All pools provide a `propose_power` method for setting power for the pool.  This
would then be distributed to the individual components in the pool, using an
algorithm that's suitable for the category of the components.  For example, when
controlling batteries, power could be distributed based on the `SoC` of the
individual batteries, to keep the batteries in balance.

### Resolving conflicting power proposals

When there are multiple actors trying to control the same set of batteries, a
target power is calculated based on the priorities of the actors making the
requests.  Actors need to specify their priorities as parameters when creating
the `*Pool` instances using the constructors mentioned above.

The algorithm used for resolving power conflicts based on actor priority can be
found in the documentation for any of the
[`propose_power`][frequenz.sdk.timeseries.battery_pool.BatteryPool.propose_power]
methods.

### Shifting the target power by an Operating Point power

There are cases where the target power needs to be shifted by an operating point.  This
can be done by designating some actors to be able to set only the operating point power.

When creating a `*Pool` instance using the above-mentioned constructors, an optional
`set_operating_point` parameter can be passed to specify that this actor is special, and
the target power of the regular actors will be shifted by the target power of all actors
with `set_operating_point` together.

In a location with 2 regular actors and 1 `set_operating_point` actor, here's how things
would play out:

1. When only regular actors have made proposals, the power bounds available from the
   batteries are available to them exactly.

   | actor priority | in op group? | proposed power/bounds | available bounds |
   |----------------|--------------|-----------------------|------------------|
   | 3              | No           | 1000, -4000..2500     | -3000..3000      |
   | 2              | No           | 2500                  | -3000..2500      |
   | 1              | Yes          | None                  | -3000..3000      |

   Power actually distributed to the batteries: 2500W

2. When the `set_operating_point` actor has made proposals, the bounds available to the
   regular actors gets shifted, and the final power that actually gets distributed to
   the batteries is also shifted.

   | actor priority | in op group? | proposed power/bounds | available bounds |
   |----------------|--------------|-----------------------|------------------|
   | 3              | No           | 1000, -4000..2500     | -2000..4000      |
   | 2              | No           | 2500                  | -2000..2500      |
   | 1              | Yes          | -1000                 | -3000..3000      |

   Power actually distributed to the batteries: 1500W
