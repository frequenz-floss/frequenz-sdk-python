    Operators and metrics need to be pushed into the engine in in-fix order, and they
    get rearranged into post-fix in the engine.  This is done using the [Shunting yard
    algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shunting_yard_algorithm).

    Example:
        To create an engine that adds the latest entries from two receivers, the
        following calls need to be made:

        ```python
        engine = FormulaEngine()
        engine.push_metric("metric_1", receiver_1)
        engine.push_oper("+")
        engine.push_metric("metric_2", receiver_2)
        engine.finalize()
        ```

        and then every call to `engine.apply()` would fetch a value from each receiver,
        add the values and return the result.
