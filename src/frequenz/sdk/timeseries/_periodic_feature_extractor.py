class PeriodicFeatureExtractor(Generic[SupportsFloatT]):
    """
    A feature extractor for historical timeseries data.

    This class is creating a profile from periodically occurring windows in a
    buffer of historical data.

    The profile is created out of all windows that are fully contained in the
    underlying buffer with the same start and end time modulo a fixed period.

    Consider for example a timeseries $T$ of historical data and sub-series
    $S_i$ of $T$ all having the same size $l$ and the same fixed distance $p$
    called period, where period of two sub-windows is defined as the distance
    of two points at the same position within the sub-windows.

    This class calculates a statistical profile $S$ over all $S_i$, i.e. the
    value of $S$ at position $i$ is calculated by performing a certain
    calculation, e.g. an average, over all values of $S_i$ at position $i$.

    Note:
        The oldest window or the window that is currently overwritten in the
        `MovingWindow` is not considered in the profile.

    Note:
        When constructing a `PeriodicFeatureExtractor` object the
        `MovingWindow` size has to be a integer multiple of the period.

        ```python
