"""Resampling function type.

A resampling function produces a new sample based on a list of pre-existing
samples. It can do "upsampling" when there data rate of the `input_samples`
period is smaller than the `resampling_period_s`, or "downsampling" if it is
bigger.

In general a resampling window is the same as the `resampling_period_s`, and
this function might receive input samples from multiple windows in the past to
enable extrapolation, but no samples from the future (so the timestamp of the
new sample that is going to be produced will always be bigger than the biggest
timestamp in the input data).

Args:
    input_samples (Sequence[Sample]): the sequence of pre-existing samples.
    resampling_period_s (float): the period in seconds (i.e. how ofter a new sample is
        produced.

Returns:
    new_sample (float): The value of new sample produced after the resampling.
