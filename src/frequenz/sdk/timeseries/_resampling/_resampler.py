    In general timeseries [`Source`][frequenz.sdk.timeseries.Source]s don't

    timeseries to produce `Sample`s at regular periodic intervals.

    This class uses
    a [`ResamplingFunction`][frequenz.sdk.timeseries._resampling.ResamplingFunction]
    to produce a new sample from samples received in the past. If there are no
    samples coming to a resampled timeseries for a while, eventually the
    `Resampler` will produce `Sample`s with `None` as value, meaning there is
    no way to produce meaningful samples with the available data.
