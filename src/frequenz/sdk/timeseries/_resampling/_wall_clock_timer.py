    could sometimes drift from the wall clock.

    When the difference is small, we say that the wall clock is *compressed* when the
    wall clock time is in the past compared to the monotonic time (the wall clock time
    passes slower than the monotonic time), and *expanded* when the wall clock time is
    in the future compared to the monotonic time (the wall clock time passes faster
    than the monotonic time).

    If the compression or expansion is big, a warning will be emitted. The definition of
    *big* is controlled by the `wall_clock_drift_tolerance_factor` configuration.

    When the difference is **too big** it is considered a *time jump*, and the timer
    will be resynced to the wall clock time and a tick will be triggered immediately.
    Time jumps can happen when the wall clock is synced by NTP after a long time being
    offline.  The definition of *too big* is controlled by the
    `wall_clock_jump_threshold` configuration.

    The ticks are aligned to the `align_to` configuration, even in the event of time
    jumps, the alignment will be preserved.

    The timer will also emit warnings if the requested sleep time is different from the
    real sleep time. This can happen if the event loop is blocked for too long, or if
    the system is under heavy load. The definition of *too long* is controlled by the
    `async_drift_tolerance` configuration.
