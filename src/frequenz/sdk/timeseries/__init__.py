Handling of timeseries streams.

A timeseries is a stream (normally an async iterator) of
[`Sample`][frequenz.sdk.timeseries.Sample]s.

# Periodicity and alignment

All the data produced by this package is always periodic and aligned to the
`UNIX_EPOCH` (by default).

Classes normally take a (re)sampling period as and argument and, optionally, an
`align_to` argument.

This means timestamps are always separated exaclty by a period, and that this
timestamp falls always at multiples of the period, starting at the `align_to`.

This ensures that the data is predictable and consistent among restarts.

Example:
    If we have a period of 10 seconds, and are aligning to the UNIX
    epoch. Assuming the following timeline starts in 1970-01-01 00:00:00
    UTC and our current `now` is 1970-01-01 00:00:32 UTC, then the next
    timestamp will be at 1970-01-01 00:00:40 UTC:

    ```
    align_to = 1970-01-01 00:00:00         next event = 1970-01-01 00:00:40
    |                                       |
    |---------|---------|---------|-|-------|---------|---------|---------|
    0        10        20        30 |      40        50        60        70
                                   now = 1970-01-01 00:00:32
    ```
