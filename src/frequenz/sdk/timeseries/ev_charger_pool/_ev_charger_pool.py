        This proposal is for the maximum power that can be set for the EV chargers in
        the pool.  The actual consumption might be lower based on the number of phases
        an EV is drawing power from, and its current state of charge.

        Power values need to follow the Passive Sign Convention (PSC). That is, positive
        values indicate charge power and negative values indicate discharge power.
        Discharging from EV chargers is currently not supported.

        If the same EV chargers are shared by multiple actors, the power manager will
        consider the priority of the actors, the bounds they set, and their preferred
        power, when calculating the target power for the EV chargers

        The preferred power of lower priority actors will take precedence as long as
        they respect the bounds set by higher priority actors.  If lower priority actors
        request power values outside of the bounds set by higher priority actors, the
        target power will be the closest value to the preferred power that is within the
        bounds.

        When there are no other actors trying to use the same EV chargers, the actor's
        preferred power would be set as the target power, as long as it falls within the
        system power bounds for the EV chargers.

        The result of the request can be accessed using the receiver returned from the
        [`power_status`][frequenz.sdk.timeseries.ev_charger_pool.EVChargerPool.power_status]
        method, which also streams the bounds that an actor should comply with, based on
        its priority.

        Args:
            power: The power to propose for the EV chargers in the pool.  If `None`,
                this proposal will not have any effect on the target power, unless
                bounds are specified.  If both are `None`, it is equivalent to not
                having a proposal or withdrawing a previous one.
            request_timeout: The timeout for the request.
            bounds: The power bounds for the proposal.  These bounds will apply to
                actors with a lower priority, and can be overridden by bounds from
                actors with a higher priority.  If None, the power bounds will be set to
                the maximum power of the batteries in the pool.  This is currently and
                experimental feature.
