    """A logical meter for calculating high level metrics in a microgrid.

    LogicalMeter provides methods for fetching power values from different points in the
    microgrid.  These methods return `FormulaReceiver` objects, which can be used like
    normal `Receiver`s, but can also be composed to form higher-order formula streams.

        ``` python
        channel_registry = ChannelRegistry(name="data-registry")
