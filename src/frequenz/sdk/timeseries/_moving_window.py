class MovingWindow:
    """
    A data window that moves with the latest datapoints of a data stream.

    After initialization the `MovingWindow` can be accessed by an integer
    index or a timestamp. A sub window can be accessed by using a slice of
    integers or timestamps.

    Note that a numpy ndarray is returned and thus users can use
    numpys operations directly on a window.

    The window uses a ring buffer for storage and the first element is aligned to
    a fixed defined point in time. Since the moving nature of the window, the
    date of the first and the last element are constantly changing and therefore
    the point in time that defines the alignment can be outside of the time window.
    Modulo arithmetic is used to move the `align_to` timestamp into the latest
    window.

    If for example the `align_to` parameter is set to
    `datetime(1, 1, 1, tzinfo=timezone.utc)` and the window size is bigger than
    one day then the first element will always be aligned to midnight.

    Resampling might be required to reduce the number of samples to store, and
    it can be set by specifying the resampler config parameter so that the user
    can control the granularity of the samples to be stored in the underlying
    buffer.

    If resampling is not required, the resampler config parameter can be
    set to None in which case the MovingWindow will not perform any resampling.

    Example: Calculate the mean of a time interval

        ```python
        window = MovingWindow(
            size=timedelta(minutes=5),
            resampled_data_recv=resampled_data_recv,
            input_sampling_period=timedelta(seconds=1),
        )

        time_start = datetime.now(tz=timezone.utc)
        time_end = time_start + timedelta(minutes=5)

        # ... wait for 5 minutes until the buffer is filled
        await asyncio.sleep(5)

        # return an numpy array from the window
        a = window[time_start:time_end]
        # and use it to for example calculate the mean
        mean = a.mean()
        ```

    Example: Create a polars data frame from a `MovingWindow`

        ```python
        import polars as pl

        # create a window that stores two days of data
        # starting at 1.1.23 with samplerate=1
        window = MovingWindow(
            size=timedelta(days=2),
            resampled_data_recv=sample_receiver,
            input_sampling_period=timedelta(seconds=1),
        )

        # wait for one full day until the buffer is filled
        asyncio.sleep(60*60*24)

        # create a polars series with one full day of data
        time_start = datetime(2023, 1, 1, tzinfo=timezone.utc)
        time_end = datetime(2023, 1, 2, tzinfo=timezone.utc)
        s = pl.Series("Jan_1", mv[time_start:time_end])
        ```
