class ConfigManagingActor(Actor):
    """An actor that monitors a TOML configuration files for updates.

    When the actor is started the configuration files will be read and sent to the
    output sender. Then the actor will start monitoring the files for updates.

    If no configuration file could be read, the actor will raise a exception.

    The configuration files are read in the order of the paths, so the last path will
    override the configuration set by the previous paths. Dict keys will be merged
    recursively, but other objects (like lists) will be replaced by the value in the
    last path.

    Example:
        If `config1.toml` contains:

        ```toml
        var1 = 1
        var2 = 2
        ```

        And `config2.toml` contains:

        ```toml
        var2 = 3
        var3 = 4
        ```

        Then the final configuration will be:

        ```py
        {
            "var1": 1,
            "var2": 3,
            "var3": 4,
        }
